int printf ( const char * format, ... );

This is the first group project that we have at ALX africa which consists of replicating the **[printf (3)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/printf.3.html)** function of language c, calling it this way **_printf.**

This function is part of the standard library **<cstdio>** and to use it we must specify the header file **<stdio.h>**.

Writes the C string pointed by format to the standard output **(stdout)**. If format includes format specifiers (subsequences beginning with **%**), the additional arguments following format are formatted and inserted in the resulting string replacing their respective specifiers.
